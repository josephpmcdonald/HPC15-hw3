In this repository I've implemented parallel Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods in
OpenMP. I give times for computing u over 25 updates with a million grid points
for a variety of thread counts ranging from 2 up 64.

I ran these computations on Stampede a few times. Both methods performed
similarly, and we see that two threads takes about twice as much time as four
threads, which takes roughly twice as much time as 8. 12 has a slightly
noticeable improvement over 8 threads. However with 16 threads the elapsed time
jumps to roughly 0.2 seconds which is much larger (about two times) than the
time for just 2 threads. 24, 32, 48 and 64 threads all show improvements
but are comparable or worse than the times for 12 and 8 threads. I was puzzled
to see this but perhaps it's because the threads run all on one node with 16
cores and perhaps these cores become overworked with multiple threads?I tried
seeing what would happen on my Courant computer with 8 cores but didn't observe
any big jump similar to this one.

The OpenMP bugs are also located in this repository with a brief description of
the bug and the fix at the top of each file.
